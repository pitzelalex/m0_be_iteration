# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

Took a bit, but very confident now

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

Productive stuggle for sure, but I'm used to googling things to figure it out. What hung me up was the capital I for Integer.sqrt() during the practice examples

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I think I've got this lesson fairly well down. Practice will come with more lessons.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

None at the moment.
